# Stock Adjustments

InvenTree provides simple yet powerful management of stock levels. Multiple stock adjustment options are available, and each type of adjustment is automatically tracked to maintain a complete stock history.

## Move Stock

Multiple stock items can be moved to a new location in a single operation. Each item is moved to the selected location, and a stock tracking entry is added to the stock item history.
